# Welcome to ESP-Robot written in Micropython
***
## Requirements specification:
1. ESP Microcontroller
2. Chassis
3. DC Motors
4. Motor Driver
5. Battery
6. Light (wb2812b)
7. Sound (R2D2 Sounds)
8. the PROGRAMM
***
## 1. ESP Microcontroller
The Robot is programmed in Micropython. So need a Microcontroller with supported Micropython.
- ESP8266
- ESP32
***
## 2. Chassis
Yes, there are a lot of chassis on the market here. If you look closer, they are only made of sheet metal or fall apart just by looking at them. A modular base is needed - Lego!
***
## 3. DC Motors
Of course, since the chassis is based on Lego, it's smart to use Lego motors.
2x Power Functions L
***
## 4. Motordriver
In any case, the L298N motor driver. It is widely used and you can find information about it in case of errors.
***
## 5. Battery
Let's think about the Battery, easy to use, easy to charging, not dangerous - a power bank !
***
## 6. Light
The Robot defentily need some lights. "A robot needs a light to help it see in the dark, just like how humans need a flashlight!"
So the Robot get some wb2812b LEDs, easy to use and found much in the network
***
## 7. Sound
Beeeep, Bep, Sound. It's very easy to you a piezo buzzer for make some R2D2 noises.
***
## 8. the PROGRAMM
Is the heart of the Robot, without, it's can do nothing!
For some month i learned Python, and so i programmed it in Micropython.
